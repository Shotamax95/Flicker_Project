# Flicker Project with Windows Form Application

**This app should perform following three actions parallelly by using Parallel class:**
* Display the selected image in the PictureBox (located at right), which the original FlickrViewer app has already provided.
* Save the selected image as is locally.
* Create thumbnail for the selected image, and save it locally.
